                ## How to setup and use Oracle Database Enterprise Edition 12c Release 2 in a Docker container on MacOS X

                #### Install Docker Desktop 
                download and install normally from [docker-mac](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac)
                #### Log in to Docker Desktop via Terminal:
                you will be prompted for your docker username and password after running this command
                
                `$ docker login`
                
                #### Pull Oracle Database Enterprise Edition 12cR2 image from Docker hub
                next, pull Oracle 12cR2 image using the following 
                
                `$ docker pull store/oracle/database-enterprise:12.2.0.1`
                
                #### Install Oracle sqlplus and Oracle client in macOS
                you need Oracle sqlplus and client to connect to the database, follow Steps 1 & 2 from the following guide
                [how-to-install-oracle-sqlplus-and-oracle-client-in-mac-os](https://tomeuwork.wordpress.com/2014/05/12/how-to-install-oracle-sqlplus-and-oracle-client-in-mac-os/)
                
                #### Add Oracle client and library to PATH
                In Terminal
                
                `$ vi ~/.bash_profile`
                
                
                Some convenient vi commands
                
                `i` to insert
                
                `:q!` to exit without saving
                
                `:qw` to save and exit
                
                In vi
                ```markdown
                export ORACLE_HOME=/Applications/oracle/product/instantclient_64/12.2.0.1
                export PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/bin:$PATH
                export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib
                ```
                save and exit vi
                
                `:qw`
                
                In Terminal
                
                `$ source ~/.bash_profile`
                
                #### Now we can setup the connection to Oracle docker container
                ##### Choice 1: Run container using automatically assigned ports (not preferred)
                over here I am giving my oracle container the name "myorcldb"
                the following command will run a docker container with Oracle database
                
                `$ docker run -d -it --name myorcldb -P --restart always store/oracle/database-enterprise:12.2.0.1`
                
                wait for a few minutes and check that container status changes from “starting” to “healthy”
                NOTE: make sure container is running everytime you reboot your machine
                
                `$ docker ps`
                
                ##### Choice 2: Run container using manually assigned ports (preferred)
                `$ docker run -d -it --name myorcldb -p <yourip>:<assignedip> --restart always store/oracle/database-enterprise:12.2.0.1`
                
                `--restart always`
                will always make sure your Oracle docker container starts up when your machine is rebooted. 
                use `docker ps` to check that your container is "healthy" before you fire up your DBMS GUI.
                
                ##### If you need to re-create the container
                `$ docker stop <container id>`
                
                `$ docker rm <container id>`
                
                ##### Check ports
                we need port information so that our Oracle client can listen to the right port that the database has exposed,
                run the following to check the port assigned
                
                `$ docker port myorcldb`
                
                since I was automatically assigned to port 32773, I will be using that information in the next step.
                
                ### Create a “tnsnames.ora” file 
                in the following directory 
                
                `/Applications/oracle/product/instantclient_64/12.2.0.1/network/admin` 
                
                create a tnsnames.ora text file, this file is used by the Oracle client to connect to the database
                
                `$ vi /Applications/oracle/product/instantclient_64/12.2.0.1/network/admin/tnsnames.ora`
                
                copy the contents below into the vi editor
                from the "check ports" step we also noticed the ip address was 0.0.0.0 i.e. localhost, hence we will use
                localhost in the connection details
                
                Contents of your tnsnames.ora file
                ```markdown
                ORCLPDB1=
                (DESCRIPTION=
                (ADDRESS=
                (PROTOCOL=TCP)
                (HOST=localhost)(PORT=1521))
                    (CONNECT_DATA=(SERVER=DEDICATED)(SERVICE_NAME=ORCLPDB1.localdomain)))
                ```
                
                and you're all set to start using your database!
                
                ### Key in the following login credentials on your DBMS GUI
                in sqldeveloper you can key in the following credientials on clicking "New connection"
                test the connection before saving
                
                ```markdown
                Connection name: <any preferred naming>
                username: system
                password: Oradoc_db1
                hostname: localhost
                port: 1521
                service name: ORCLPDB1.localdomain
                ```
                
                ### Since I personally like using DBeaver
                you may download it from [dbeaver.io/download/](https://dbeaver.io/download/)
                the credientials are similar but in different fields
                test the connection before saving
                
                ```markdown
                Host: localhost
                Port: 1521
                Database: ORCLPDB1.localdomain [Service name]
                username: system
                password: Oradoc_db1
                ```
                
                ### Create a database User 
                your database comes clean with no users created, you can create a user account for your specific needs
                with the following command by running the below in the DBMS GUI as SYSTEM admin
                `CREATE USER student IDENTIFIED BY studentpassword;
                
                GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES TO student;
                
                DEFAULT TABLESPACE USERS TEMPORARY TABLESPACE TEMP;`
                
                ### Log in to your newly created user
                dbeaver
                
                ```markdown
                Host: localhost
                Port: 1521
                Database: ORCLPDB1.localdomain [Service name]
                username: student
                password: studentpassword
                ```
                
                ### Usage
                since the docker container is running backend, stopping the docker container will stop the database service but your data will not be lost.
                
                you will lose your database if you remove the docker container.
                do not remove the docker container! If you do so you will have to restart the setup process again.
                
                if you dislike using the `--restart always` argument in the `docker run ... store/oracle/database-enterprise:12.2.0.1` command as shown above, you would have to manual start the docker container everytime daemon or your machine is rebooted by typing `docker start <container name>`.
